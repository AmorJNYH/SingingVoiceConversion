# SingingVoiceConversion
This is 7100 Project from Fall 2022 to Spring 2023.
## Dataset
We used the NUS sung and spoken lyrics corpus (NUS- 48 database) as data set. The NUS-48 database is a 169-min collection of audio recordings of the sung and spoken lyrics of 48 English songs by 12 subjects.

We found that the vocal range in the NUS-48 database is limited, so we picked ten songs at random in the NUS-48 database as Group 1, and we collected another ten songs as Group 2. The information of the Group 1 data set is shown in Table. II.
